changes: 
  - balance: "Civilian Bounty Cubes now pay out 30% of the value of the cube, up from 10%."
  - balance: "Cargo Crates are now worth 200 credits each. Cargo crate prices have seen some tweaks as well for more uncommonly ordered crates as well."
  - bugfix: "You can no longer cheat the bounty system by slapping a new price tag over a bounty cube."
  - refactor: "The values of cargo crates you can order are now scaled in terms of the value of cargo crates."
