## Title: Sizeplay stuff

MODULE ID: SIZEPLAY

### Description

The PR introduces:

- a size ray gun that can enlarge or shrinkify people (for now admin-spawn and ghost cafe only)
- picking tiny people up like items (configurable)
- squishing tiny people when you step on them, with effect depending on intent chosen (configurable)
- slowdowns for micros

Be careful. The configs are not designed for being reloaded mid-game, so if you do so, things will get wonky.
